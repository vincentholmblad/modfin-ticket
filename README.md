Scaffolding for ticket case

Clone the project, delete the git folder and add it to you project context

To get started you need docker and docker compose install, once that is done run `docker-compose up`. 
This should bootstrap the project, the database and so on. Once up you should be able to curl some thing to that end 
the existing api endpoint
eg. `curl http://localhost:8000/api/tickets`
